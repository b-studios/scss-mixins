My SCSS-Helper Collection
=========================

I collected the mixins which i think that maybe reuseable in other projects. To use them, simply (https://github.com/b-studios/scss-mixins download the SCSS-Partials) and include them in your main-stylesheet and off you go.

    @import 'helper';
